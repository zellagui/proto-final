One of the nation's fastest growing retailers, Family Dollar offers a compelling assortment of merchandise for the whole family ranging from household cleaners to name brand foods, from health and beauty aids to toys, from apparel for every age to home fashions, all for everyday low prices. While shoppers can find many items at $1 or less, most items in the store are priced below $10, which makes shopping fun without stretching the family budget.\n\nAs shoppers enter their neighborhood Family Dollar, they'll find great values on the name brands they trust in a clean, well-organized store staffed with friendly team members who are members of the local community. The average size of a Family Dollar store is approximately 7,000 square feet, and most stores are operated in leased facilities. This relatively small footprint allows the Company to open new stores in rural areas and small town, as well as in large urban neighborhoods. Within these markets, the stores are located in shopping centers or as free-standing building and all are convenient to the Company's customer base.\n\nFamily Dollar offers a compelling mix of merchandise for the whole family. Ranging from an expanded assortment of refrigerated and frozen foods and health and beauty items to home d√©cor and seasonal items, Family Dollar offers the lowest possible price, the name brand and quality private-brand merchandise customers need and use every day.Show moreShow less",
