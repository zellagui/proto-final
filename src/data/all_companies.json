These developments aim to enhance speed, reliability, and contribute to the region‚Äôs decarbonization efforts in the coming years.\n\nThe RER A and B networks in Paris, operated byRATPgroup, recently proved their efficiency once again during the 2024 Olympic Games where tens of thousands of people were successfully transported quickly and safely. As a subsidiary of RATP Group, we take immense pride in our role in ensuring the event's success.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the RER lines, we invite you to explore more about the system and the significant strides made at RATP Dev over the past two decades to modernize Europe's busiest rail network. (About RER:https://lnkd.in/gjVQhcQP)  RATP Group successfully completed system-wide electrification, introduced state-of-the-art amenities, and improved service frequency, reliability, and safety‚Äîall while maintaining daily operations. The skilled engineers and operations staff ensured the seamless maintenance of service while achieving ambitious goals with considerable capital investment.\n\nWe wish the MBTA and the state of Massachusetts the best of luck as they embark on their own ambitious rail transformation. We look forward to watching their progress.\n\nRead the full article here:https://lnkd.in/gNSyJCxMLearn more about RATP Dev:https://lnkd.in/eh6hCSMw#MBTA#RER#CommuterRail#TransitInnovation#PublicTransit#RATPDev#RATPDevUSA",

Set to operate more than 875 Restaurants and eclipse nearly $5B in sales by the end of the year, we owe it all to our leaders who are driving the business forward each and every day. Attendees for the all-expenses-paid trip included all Restaurant Leaders, Business Unit and Restaurant Support Crew along with their spouses or significant others.\n\nTo kick things off, leaders and their guests arrived on Sunday to a fully Cane‚Äôs branded five-star resort in Canc√∫n where they received Canec√∫n-branded swag bags and started the trip with a welcome reception filled with drinks, music and good times. Monday was filled with leisure and an array of optional activities including beach volleyball and yoga and optional sessions for financial wellbeing; ‚ÄúMaking Millionaires,‚Äù which detailed all elements of the Raising Cane‚Äôs Restaurant Partner Program including the long-term incentive program that allows the Restaurant Partners to become millionaires within seven to 10 years; maximizing benefits; optimizing mental energy; Spanish lessons and more. \n\nLater in the day, attendees gathered to hear from Owner and Founder Todd Graves about the history of Cane‚Äôs and co-CEO and COO AJ Kumaran. Kumaran talked about the industry leading programs Cane‚Äôs has in place as well as upcoming programs to help Raising Cane‚Äôs scale to become a top 10 US Restaurant Brand in sales.\n\nLater in the evening, Graves‚Äô good friend and Emmy-award winning rapper and producer Snoop Dogg joined him on stage for a fireside chat about entrepreneurism, work ethic, leadership, family and success. While on stage, Graves presented Snoop, who is a huge Bruce Lee fan,¬†with Bruce Lee‚Äôs famous nunchucks from Enter the Dragon as a gift of appreciation for coming to Cancun to both inspire and entertain Cane‚Äôs leaders. \n¬†\nDirectly following, attendees went outside for a drone and firework show and concert from Snoop Dogg where he sang and DJ‚Äôd.\n¬†\nOn Tuesday morning, nine-time Olympic gold medalist spoke to leaders about inspiration, motivation, and chasing a dream. Following Ledecky‚Äôs keynote, she was joined by Graves and Kumaran on stage for a Q&A session where they asked about how Katie stays motivated and what it means to be a leader.\n\nTo round out Canec√∫n, leaders were encouraged to take the rest of Tuesday to rest and relax before departing on Wednesday.¬†\n\nThanks to everyone who had a hand in making Canecun a reality. Here's to more big things in the future.",

                "text": "Since February 2023, I‚Äôve proudly served as Project Manager ofTulane Trash to Treasure(T2T), a student-led waste reduction and community service initiative. We collect donated dorm items during move-out and resell them at huge discounts during the following year‚Äôs move-in week, with all profits going to local charities.\n\nFirst, I have to shout out our incredible student executive board (Laine Benard,Eleanor Bruner,Diya Karthic,William M.,Ella Moses, Daniel Ralph, Shruti Srinivasan,Yang Tao, &Maya Wilson-Ehrenthal), Office of Sustainability Director Jordan Stewart,Tulane Center for Public Service(CPS) Associate DirectorMaurice S., and CPS Program LeaderRiley Garrett.\n\nIn October,Keep Louisiana Beautifulhonored T2T with the Collegiate Environmental Steward Award, recognizing ten years of service and leadership. To build on this success, we prioritized fostering new collaborations and scaling up operations to better serve the growing on-campus population.\n\nThe 2024 Move-Out Collection was our biggest ever, expanding from four to seven donation drop-off stations and diverting over 370,000 pounds of reusable items from landfills! Our friends at Tulane CPS sorted and transferred more than 15 tons of items to local organizations. Partnerships withGoodwill Industries of Southeastern Louisianaand Tulane Shuttles & Transportation provided vehicles and drivers to expand our reach. Joint marketing efforts withGlass Half FullandStudents Against Food Insecurity (SAFI)encouraged glass recycling and food donations during our collection.\n\nAdditionally, we joined Tulane's CACTUS network to strengthen ties with other service orgs and secure university funding for the first time. We also co-hosted fun events withLouisiana SPCAto bring adoptable dogs to campus and with First-Year Experience to give out free snoballs during finals!\n\nI look forward to staying involved next year after passing the torch to the dedicated and experiencedElla Moses. T2T is in good hands!\n\nThank you all for helping make our campus more sustainable, and as always ‚Äì stay trashy! üóëÔ∏èüíé",
