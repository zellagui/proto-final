Resumes 101: Best Practices

Your resume is your ticket to landing a job interview, so it’s essential to make it as strong as possible. At GhostJobs.io, we’re here to help you navigate the job search with confidence and transparency. Here are some best practices for creating a resume that will grab the attention of recruiters and Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) alike.

#### Best Practice #1: Use a Simple, Single-Column Layout

While it might be tempting to use a modern, two-column resume design, this can actually work against you when applying through company websites or job boards like Indeed or LinkedIn. The reason? Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

**Why is this important?**  
ATS software reads resumes from top to bottom, left to right. If your resume has multiple columns or complex elements like graphics or logos, the system may struggle to interpret it correctly. This can result in important information being misread or missed altogether.

**What should you do instead?**  
Opt for a traditional, single-column format. Keep the design simple and clean—Microsoft Word or Google Docs are ideal tools for this. If you need a template, check out this basic resume template we recommend: Standard Resume Template

#### Best Practice #2: Add Specific Context to Your Achievements

Your resume should tell your unique story and highlight your accomplishments in a way that stands out. The key to achieving this is context—providing specific details that make your achievements meaningful.

*   **Generic Statement:** “Achieved excellent sales results.”
*   **Contextualized Statement:** “Earned top spot in the company’s 2023 national sales rankings by achieving 220% of the annual sales target.”

The second statement is much more impactful because it provides concrete details and quantifies your success.

**How to add context to your resume:**  
A great format to follow is PAR (problem, action, result) or STAR (situation, task, action, result). As an example:

*   **Identify the Problem(s):** you/the company faced. This could be an explicit problem or an implied goal you needed to achieve.
*   **Describe the Action(s):** you took to address the challenge. Focus on what you did, rather than what your team or manager did.
*   **Highlight the Result(s):** of your actions. Whether it’s a major achievement or a smaller victory, make sure the result is clear and ideally quantifiable ($, #, %).

**Putting it all together:**  
The descriptions don’t necessarily need to be in exact format, but highlight results through actions that solved problems.

**Example:**  
*   **Problem:** Low conversion  
    **Action:** Designing a lead scoring system  
    **Result:** Increased lead conversion by 30% and pipeline by 20%  
    Boosted low conversion by designing a lead scoring system within Salesforce, increasing lead conversion by 30%, while growing the pipeline by 20%.

**Example:**  
*   **Problem:** Product launch delays, poor cross-department collaboration  
    **Action:** Introduced project management tools  
    **Result:** Cut time-to-market by 25% and increased market share by 10%  
    Solved product launch delays caused by poor cross-department collaboration by introducing project management tools, cutting time-to-market by 25% and increasing market share by 10%.

**Pro ChatGPT tip:**  
Upload your resume to ChatGPT and use a prompt such as this:

Use my resume attached to recreate my resume job descriptions in both a PAR and STAR format. PAR stands for problem, action, result and STAR stands for situation, task, action, result. Put the elements together so they are just one sentence and not too wordy. Also start with some sort of action verb for each job description. Do not repeat the same action verbs at the start of job descriptions. Make the results clear and quantifiable. As much as you can and where it’s relevant, match keywords, role requirements, skills, and phrases found in the job description below:

#### Best Practice #3: Tailor Your Resume to the Role

Think of your resume as a tailored suit—it should fit the job you’re applying for perfectly. Submitting a generic resume is like wearing an off-the-rack suit to a custom event; it just doesn’t make the right impression.

**Why is this important?**  
A tailored resume shows that you understand the job requirements and are serious about the role. It helps you stand out from the competition and makes it easier for recruiters to see why you’re a good fit.

**How to tailor your resume:**

*   Carefully read the job posting. Take note of the required experience, skills, and qualifications.
*   Put yourself in the recruiter’s shoes. Can they quickly and easily identify the qualifications they’re looking for in your resume?
*   Match your language to the job description. Use the same terms and phrases the employer uses in their posting.

**Examples:**

*   If a company is looking for someone with 5 years of experience doing X, start your resume with: “X Professional with 5+ years of experience in X.”
*   If specific certifications are required, list them under a clearly labeled “Certifications” section, exactly as they appear in the job description.

You can use the Pro ChatGPT tip found above to help tailor keywords accordingly.

**What to avoid:**

*   Copy-pasting the job description into your resume. This can come across as disingenuous and is easy to spot.
*   Lying or embellishing your accomplishments. Honesty is always the best policy. If you’re put on the spot during an interview, any false claims could quickly unravel.

#### How This Prepares You for Common Interview Questions

When it comes to interviews, the way you present your resume plays a big role in how you answer common questions. Following the best practices we outlined not only makes your resume stand out but also prepares you to confidently handle typical interview questions. Here’s how:

*   **“Tell me about yourself.”**  
    By crafting a resume that highlights your unique accomplishments and experience with specific context, you’ll already have a concise summary of your career path ready to go. Reference the key points in your resume when answering this question to create a structured, engaging response.

*   **“What’s your greatest achievement?”**  
    Since your resume already includes quantifiable, contextualized accomplishments (thanks to the best practice of adding specific examples), you’ll have ready-made success stories to share during the interview. Choose a relevant achievement from your resume that aligns with the role you’re applying for.

*   **“Why do you want to work here?”**  
    Tailoring your resume to each specific role (as recommended) means you’ve already done your homework on the company and position. Use this research to show that you understand the company's needs and how your skills and values align with their goals.

*   **“What are your strengths and weaknesses?”**  
    If you’ve followed the steps to identify and assess your skills, you’ll have a clear understanding of your strengths and any areas for improvement. Use examples from your resume that showcase your strongest skills, and acknowledge areas where you’re actively working to improve or grow.

*   **“Why should we hire you?”**  
    A well-tailored resume is your foundation for this question. You’ve already positioned yourself as a perfect fit for the role by aligning your experience and skills with the job description. In the interview, build on this by elaborating on how you can bring value to the company, referencing the key qualifications and achievements in your resume.
